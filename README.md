This Cursed World
====
**Introducing Dota RPG. . . Again!**

*This Cursed World* is an ambitious project to provide the second persistent RPG world inside Dota 2.

Unlike its predecessor "The Black Road", TCW aims to provide an ARPG-style gameplay similar to that of the Diablo 2 mod Median XL while combining modern role playing elements from games such as Diablo 3, Path of Exile, and World of Warcraft.

We’re still looking to increase our modding team, so if you are interested in joining the project and think you can help in any area don’t hesitate to contact us.

Currently in dire need of an experienced level designer. The default fruity DotA landscape doesn't provide the gloomy depths-of-hell experience tha Diablo 2 provides. If you have experience with the Source engine and would like to help create an immersive RPG experience than please contact us.
